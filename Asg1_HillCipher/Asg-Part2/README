In this program, Code for Cryptanalysis of hill cipher is wriiten

Here, I have assumed length of key to be 1,2,3 or 4

And, According to length of key, I have taken most frequent unigrams, bigrams,trigrams and quadgrams of english language.

To run program, simply used this command :

python hill_cryptanalysis.py keylength cipherfile

Note : keylength - any numeric value - 1 to 4
       
       cipherfile - contain ciphertext


out_crypt.txt file will be produced which contain possible plaintext

I have written key,keyinverse and ioc for each plaintext produced in the file
